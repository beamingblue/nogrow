# Don't Grow NOW!

Prevent crops from growing by doctoring farmland

---

Want to stop crop growth for aesthetic purposes? Tired of those pesky players trampling on your farms? Then Don't Grow NOW! is just the right mod for you! Just apply some fermented:tm: bone meal to farmland and you're good to go!

## Installation

Place the mod's jar file to your `mods` directory. Make sure you have installed [Fabric API](modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) or [Quilt Standard Libraries](modrinth.com/mod/qsl) too.

## Gameplay

*Fermented Bone Meal* can be crafted using 8 bone meals and 1 fermented spider eye. It can be applied on farmland by right clicking or by dispensing it into farmland, turning it into *Doctored Farmland*. It prevents:

<li> Farmland blocks from dehydrating and turning into dirt </li>
<li> Crops from growing </li>
<li> Players and mobs from trampling on farmland blocks </li>

Doctored farmland can also be picked up when broken with a shovel enchanted with Silk Touch, to be moved somewhere else.

Doctored farmland can be converted back into normal farmland by right clicking with a water bottle or using a dispenser to do so and crops will be able to grow again.
